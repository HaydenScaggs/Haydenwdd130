        [Blood Gauge increase and depletion is gradual, and the effects of multiple moves stack if additional moves are used before the effects of previous moves are finished. For example, using 214H into 623H in quick succession will fill the gauge by 180 points, even if the latter is used before the effect of the former is finished. This applies for gauge increases, gauge depletion and a mix of the two, which can be used to your advantage.]

      <p>[At two Blood bars, the dynamic shifts completely. Nagoriyuki wonâ€™t be able to go for the same mix-ups due to the risk of entering Blood Rage. Instead, the goal is to use his enhanced sword normals, such as 5H




        , to punish unsuccessful approach attempts. With one or more Blood bars, 5H has outstanding range and good speed, outranging even f.S. At two Blood bars it is a great tool to keep the opponent at bay</p>
